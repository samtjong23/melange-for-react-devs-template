# Melange for React Developers

I undertake this project as part of my application to [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/) for the [ReasonML Developer](https://ahrefs.com/jobs/reasonml-developer) role. Within the one and a half weeks I spent on this project, I have learned about ReasonML and its fundamentals for frontend development. This project is built as an extension of the [Melange for React Developers](https://github.com/melange-re/melange-for-react-devs) template.

## Quick Start

```shell
npm run init

# In separate terminals:
npm run watch
npm run serve
```

## Key Takeaways

### What I Learned

- Utilizing ReasonML in conjunction with React and Melange to create a fully functional frontend application.
- Gaining a deeper understanding of CSS for styling custom components, having previously relied mainly on ready-made components.

### What I Like About Using ReasonML

- The strong type system which enhances confidence in the code (it's like you can be confident that if it compiles it works), ensuring fewer bugs and facilitating easier refactoring.
- The concise and expressive `switch` syntax boosts productivity and readability as compared to nested `if else` statements.

### Areas for Improvement

- Definitely my CSS skills since, for example, on the order confirmation page, the spacing for fields for burgers and other item types are different due to something I am still figuring out.
- I also used Tailwind for counter and celsius converter pages but not for order confirmation (which I tried but it was flaky), so I am still digging into the reason behind that (my guess is this might have to do with my understanding of Melange).
- Gaining a deeper understanding of Melange, the nitty-gritty details. I was hoping to use React Router to improve project navigation but couldn't quite figure it out due to the way the project is structured.

## Why I Would Like to Join Ahrefs

- The product and content are impressive. After watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5hH_lt8Guw&t=1580s&ab_channel=Ahrefs), I see why people use Ahrefs; the team makes it easy to learn and use this powerful tool. This strongly aligns with me since I love creating products that positively impact people's lives.
- Great products are made by great people. I'm eager to learn from a team that understands their audience and can bring their vision to life despite technical challenges. I firmly believe working alongside the talented team at Ahrefs will help me become a better engineer.
- Ahrefs supports employee growth. Based on my understanding from this [article](https://tech.ahrefs.com/ahrefs-is-now-built-with-melange-b14f5ec56df4), the team at Ahrefs actively contributes to Melange development with the company's backing. This shows their willingness to innovate and commitment to developing their engineers, creating the ideal environment for someone like me, who is early in their career.

## Why I Am a Great Fit for This Role

- I have prior frontend experience from my roles as a Software Engineer at ShopBack and a Software Engineer Intern at Zendesk which definitely puts me in a great starting spot to contribute in the team in Ahrefs.
- I am a passionate learner capable of quickly grasping new skills and concepts. My rapid mastery of ReasonML for this project demonstrates my ability to efficiently learn any new framework, tool or programming language, ensuring I can effectively contribute to any project I am assigned at Ahrefs.
